    quotes: [
      "The reason we have poverty is that we have no imagination. There are a great number of people accumulating what they think is vast wealth, but it's only money... they don't know how to enjoy it, because they have no imagination",
      "To have faith is to trust yourself to the water. When you swim you don't grab hold of the water, because if you do you will sink and drown. Instead you relax and float."
